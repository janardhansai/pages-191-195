        <p>Factors to take into consideration when deciding upon appropriate channels of communication include ability to access “real time” information, the need to communicate
quickly with the nominated clinician and to agree the method of communication with the
patient. The device supports the delivery of clinical information delivered in “real time”,
which can be readily accessed and understood by all stakeholders, including patients
and their carers who are involved in the management of chronic conditions.</p>
        <p> The information held within the system covers:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Schedules for prescription against which alerts/actions may be triggered. These
alerts will be negotiated at an individual patient level and after consultation with
the nominated clinician. It is envisaged that these alerts will eventually be sent to
a nominated pharmacy to ensure and support efficient and timely prescription of
the required drugs to patients</li><br>
        <li>Drug dosing information (prescription) received from the devices, these data will
be tested against the schedule</li><br>
        <li>Drug name—the patient may be taking more that one type of drug therapy and
it is therefore important to distinguish which drug has been taken.</li><br>
            <li>Dose prescribed</li><br>
            <li>Frequency—will enable accurate data to be collected to map actual use
against planned use</li><br>
            <li> Alerting rules</li><br>
            <li>Remaining inhalations</li><br>
            <li>Date next prescription is due</li><br>
            
            <br>
            <br>
          
            <li>  Drug taken—information from the inhaler device</li>
            <br>
            <li>Patient ID—NHS number, or device number that matches to the patient</li>
            <br>
            <li>Drug name</li><br>
            <li>Breathing profile indicator</li><br>
            <li>Device malfunction status flag</li><br>
            <li>When a drug event is received, it is checked against the most recent schedule.</li><br>
<li>Check for remaining inhalations; if down to last inhalation send “in-tray” alert
    to nominated clinician</li><br>
<li>Check against Alerting rules; if fails check create “in-tray” item to nominated
    clinician</li><br>
            <li>Check value of Breathing Profile indicator; if outside normal profile create “intray” item for nominated clinician</li><br>
            <li>Create drug event and store in electronic healthcare record</li>

        </center>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
        
       <p> Integration of home based drug delivery devices to capture and disseminate clinical data
and information into daily clinical practice must be subjected to thorough and rigorous
evaluation at every stage of the procurement and implementation process. A key element
of evaluation is the need to identify “best practices” relating to device use and patient
feedback, ensuring that is rolled out to the wider clinical community and embedded in the
development of future asthma management plans, along with clinical protocols and
guidelines. Unless it can be demonstrated that mobile devices have improved
organisational effectiveness as well as contributing to an improvement in patient care,
and have subscribed to the development of clinical care in general, their contribution to
           the clinical knowledge management process will be devalued.</p>
        
       <p> Academic clinical studies will be required to evaluate the benefits of home based drug
delivery systems focusing on the possible clinical benefit to the patient and additional
benefit to clinical care, looking at the use of the device by patients with little or no ICT
skills, an increase in patient involvement in the care management process and the level
of patient compliance compared with those patients not using the device. Randomised
trials indicate improvement in patient health and reduction in healthcare costs (Simon,
Von Korff, Rutter, & Wagner, 2000). The return on investment should be measured in
terms of any increase in the level of patient care and any advancement in the knowledge
           relating to chronic clinical conditions.</p>

                </center>
        <div class="paragraph">
            
        <p>As adoption of integrated devices into daily clinical practice becomes more commonplace, the opportunity arises for innovative uses in the clinical setting to be explored.
The device can be used for clinical trials to record and transmit data that are costly to
capture by traditional methods. The ability to record the patients breathing profile could
enable the relationship between a successful dose deposition of the drug being delivered
to the lungs and the patient ability to match their pre-determined “perfect profile”. This
information would be of use in the future development of novel drug therapies and would
also provide the clinical community with invaluable information relating to patterns of
inhaler use and effectiveness.</p>

        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Successful implementation of the device into daily clinical use will require commitment
from patients/carers, individual healthcare professionals as well as healthcare
organisations. A tailored training infrastructure for all is essential, not only to demonstrate correct use, but also demonstrate benefits that can be achieved from the device
on an individual basis. The integration of the device into daily clinical practice will only
be achieved if issues associated with it are incorporated into clinical teaching practice
and continuous professional development programmes. Although training can be
expensive and time consuming, it is an investment that is critical to the acceptance of all
home based clinical systems. Home-based drug delivery devices are likely to generate
data to populate mature information databases to inform clinical practice and may
            facilitate the growing trend to decentralisation of care.</p>

            </center>
        
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Uptake of novel drug delivery devices will depend on many factors, including
organisational support, effective training infrastructure, reliable systems, integration
with legacy systems, data standards, workflow patterns, privacy and security, and
healthcare standards. In the US, drivers to ensure successful implementation will be
improved clinical outcomes and the ability to bill patients for each element of a clinical
episode at the point of care. In the UK, more emphasis will be placed on the ability to input
and retrieve data and information using an “integrated electronic healthcare record”
accessible by clinicians and allied health professionals at the point of care, regardless
            of location</p>
    <p> It is essential to involve all stakeholders in the debate relating to the goals of clinical
knowledge management and the strategies required to achieve them. Presently, clinical
        information is not currently disseminated in a way that facilitates understanding by</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
            
        <div class="paragraph">    
        <p>patients. Patient awareness of their rights to access clinical data is patchy and channels
of access to information are not well developed. The use of abbreviations and codes acts
as a barrier to understanding by non-clinicians. Patients with specific knowledge relating
to chronic conditions require tailored communication infrastructures to be developed
before they can take their place as equal partners in the care process. It is essential that
all stakeholders are comfortable with clinicians adopting a supportive role to enable
patients to recognise deteriorating asthma and for patients be relaxed about taking a
pivotal role in the self-management of their own medication to prevent deterioration in
their condition. Discontinuity and lack of communication between primary care, emergency departments, and even within secondary care may hinder the development of an
integrated care programme for asthma.</p>
        
        <p>The way to address this is through greater involvement of patients in their own
management. The use of a drug delivery device that includes the use of a patient diary
will go some way to support an integrated care programme for the management of the
asthmatic patient. Thus the drug delivery device is the integrator that underpins the
integrated care process. The electronic healthcare record is the repository that is pivotal
to the knowledge sharing activity that is required to empower all stakeholders in the care
process and capture “real time” clinical information to add to knowledge already held
about a chronic clinical condition. Many clinicians complain that they suffer from
“information overload”; mobile communication devices are one of the tools that can be
utilised to support clinical knowledge management in the modern healthcare setting.</p>
